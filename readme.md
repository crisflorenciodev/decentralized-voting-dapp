# Decentralized Voting dApp

Welcome to the Decentralized Voting dApp repository! This project aims to create a decentralized application (dApp) for conducting secure and transparent voting using blockchain technology. Users can participate in various types of voting events, such as elections, surveys, or decision-making processes, with the assurance of anonymity and tamper-proof results.

## Introduction

Traditional voting systems often lack transparency and are susceptible to manipulation. By leveraging blockchain technology, this decentralized voting dApp ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting processes. Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain govern the voting events, while the frontend interface allows users to interact with the application seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum Blockchain
- Solidity
- Web3.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Truffle Framework
- Metamask

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `contracts`: Contains Solidity smart contract files for managing voting events.
- `frontend`: Includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- `test`: Contains test scripts for smart contracts.
- `docs`: Includes additional documentation files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Decentralized Voting dApp, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-voting-dapp.git
